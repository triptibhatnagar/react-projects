-------------------- REACT 02 --------------------

NEEDED TOOLS - 
vs code
node js
    node -v (to check node version)
react documentation
DOCUMENTATION - website: react.dev

REACT + REACT-DOM => for web
REACT + REACT-NATIVE => for app


### MAKING REACT PROJECT ??

- npm = node package manager
- npx = node package executor [for direct use w/o installation]
- create-react-app [bulky utility]
---> npx create-react-app <project-name>
- as it was bulky, we use bundlers like vite or parcel


### EXPLORING FILE FOLDER STRUCTURE

- cd <project-name>
- open package.json : entry point [ name, version, dependencies ]
- dependencies: versions of :-
    testing library,
    react,
    react-dom,
    react-scripts,
    web-vitals [to check/track performance of your app]
- scripts [run or ready the projects for production] :
    start: in dev env,
    build: in prod env,
    test: to run all test cases, 
    eject: eject application from react, now introducing new framework in my project
- eslint [ red error lines ]
- browserslist [ which browsers to work on ]


### HOW TO RUN REACT PROJECT ??

- run start script
- on ls : package.json must be visible, now you can run start script
---> npm run start
- lets run build
---> npm run build
build folder is created
- react projects are not SEO optimized [ nothing special visible on PAGE SOURCE]
- [static assets, js etc]


### USING BUNDLER - VITE

- on ls : should be in root folder
---> npm create vite@latest

### EXPLORING FILE FOLDER STRUCTURE IN VITE

- node_modules not in vite project
- package.json: 
    name,
    version,
    scripts - 
        dev (npm run dev),
        build (npm run build) etc..
    dependencies - 
        only react and react-dom
    dev dependencies - used during dev only not prod


### HOW TO RUN REACT PROJECT IN VITE ??

---> cd <project-name>
---> npm install
---> npm run dev


### CLEANING FILE FOLDER STRUCTURE CREATED FROM create-react-app

- delete all folders of src except App.js and index.js


### CLEANING FILE FOLDER STRUCTURE CREATED FROM create-react-app

- delete all folders of src except App.jsx and main.jsx
