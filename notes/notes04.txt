-------------------- REACT 04 --------------------

-> create your own react basic version

- Selecting element
- Creating root
- Component which returns HTML element
- Render component into root


SUMMARIZE
- created own react element
    - container -> root
    - render(elem, container) [a custom render method]
    - created custom elem

- main.jsx
    - write a method in this file and render it, can be done in </> or ()
    - react -> tree str, so use tree str (object) directly but didn't worked
    - as it is html element wrapped inside () worked, but why not my object
    - problem is my obj is custom, not following any syntax acc to react
    - used React.createElement(<type, attributes, children, evaluated expressions>) [injection done by Babel]
