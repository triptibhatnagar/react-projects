### REACT-SPECIFIC INTERVIEW QUESTION

const [counter, setCounter] = useState(5)
const addValue = () => {
    setCounter(counter+1)
    setCounter(counter+1)
    setCounter(counter+1)
    setCounter(counter+1)
}

what will be the value displayed after clicking on add button???

ANS => counter+1 on 1 click


UNDERLYING CONCEPT
- useState sends updation in batches
- so a batch will be created of these 4
    setCounter(counter+1)
    setCounter(counter+1)
    setCounter(counter+1)
    setCounter(counter+1)
- u are doing same work again (u say ki areyy same hee toh kaam h)

- SOLUTION
- but what if i want to update it in same way
    setCounter(() => {})   callback in setCounter
    setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter+1)
    prevCounter -> last updated state

- through callback
    its a new call after completing the work(here after increment)
