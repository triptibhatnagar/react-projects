VIRTUAL DOM FIBRE RECONCILATION

- is virtual dom still used in react ?? NOOOO
- createRoot() 

## BTS of createRoot()
- create a dom tree like browser dom
- compares its dom with main dom and updates only the UI changes
- but browser repaints whole DOM(RELOADING)

- REACT team thinks of : not immediately updating in UI, but with optimzed algo and waiting an instant

## FIBRE
- algorithm to update virtual DOM = REACT FIBER

The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.


Other key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.
hydration  (injecting of js)

## RECONCILIATION
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.

update
A change in the data used to render a React app. Usually the result of `setState`. Eventually results in a re-render.

~~~~~~~~~ Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM.








-----------------------------------------
React Fiber, Reconciliation & Virtual DOM — Ekdum Simple Terms Me
⭐ 1. Virtual DOM

Virtual DOM = Browser DOM ka lightweight copy (memory me).

React real DOM ko directly modify nahi karta (slow hota hai).

Pehle virtual DOM banata hai → phir compare karke sirf jaha change hua ho wahi real DOM update karta hai.

Isse app fast chalti hai.

👉 Example:
Tumhare room ka photo (virtual DOM) le kar changes mark karna → phir room me sirf wahi changes apply karna → pura room rebuild nahi karna.

⭐ 2. Reconciliation

Reconciliation = React ka process jisme wo naya virtual DOM aur purana virtual DOM compare karta hai.

Matlab:

Pehle app ka ek virtual DOM hota hai

Update hone par naya virtual DOM banta hai

React dono compare karta hai (diff algorithm)

Sirf changed parts ko update karta hai

👉 List me key isliye important hoti hai taaki React ko pata chal sake kaun sa item same hai aur kaunsa new.

⭐ 3. React Fiber

Fiber = React ka naya engine jo updates ko chote-chote parts me tod kar handle karta hai.

Old React:

Ek update aaya → pura kaam ek baar me karta tha → UI freeze ho sakti thi

React Fiber:

Kaam ko small pieces (fibers) me todta hai

Kabhi bhi pause kar sakta hai

Kabhi bhi resume kar sakta hai

High priority tasks (animations, user typing) ko pehle karta hai

Low priority work baad me karta hai

👉 This makes React smoother, faster, aur better scheduling wala.
