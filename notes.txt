react + react-dom => for web
react + react-native => for app

### how to make a react project ??

npm = node pacakage manager
npx = node package executor [for direct use w/o installation]

create-react-app [bulky utility]

---> npx create-react-app <project-name>

as it was bulky, we use binders like vite

open package.json : entry point [ name, version, dependencies ]

testing library, react, react-dom, react-scripts, web-vitals [to check/track performance of your app], scripts [run or ready the projects] (start: in dev env, build: in prod env, test: to test, eject: eject application from react, now introducing new framework), eslint [ red error lines ], browserlist [ which browsers to work on ]


## how to run

run start script

---> npm run start

lets run build

---> npm run build

build folder is created

[static assets, js etc]


### using bundler - vite

npm create vite@latest


### differences

node_modules not in vite project

package.json

[ name, version, scripts - dev (npm run dev), dependencies - only react and react-dom, dev depndencies - used during dev only not prod ]

### run this
---> cd <project-name>
---> npm install
---> npm run dev


from project created with create-react-app, delete all folders of src except App.js and index.js
